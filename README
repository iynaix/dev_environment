Introduction
============

A set of ansible playbooks to help set up my (opinionated) development environment from a base arch install.

This is scratching my own itch that setting up a customized work environment takes up way more memory and effort than I care to do.

TODO
====

- Packages from AUR
- Symlinks
- git setup
- vim setup
- zsh setup
- theme setup
- machine specific setup
